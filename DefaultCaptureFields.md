# Default Capture Fields

The following fields are considered the default Profile for a Consumer.

These fields should be returned when an API endpoint requests Default Fields.

- First name
- Last name
- Email 
- Mobile
- Birth date
- Gender
- Location (Province)

An example of this is during Campaign Creation:

When a User selects `SMS Shortcode` or `Webform` as **Engagement Channels**, these fields should be populated in the list of Capture Fields.
