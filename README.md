# Direct Messaging Platform

## Platform Functionality

This platform allows the business to segment their database of *consumers*, and create & track new marketing *campaigns* & *programs* aimed at those segments.

Each campaign or program is allocated to a specific *brand*.
The business can have multiple brands, and brands can have multiple campaigns & programs.

----

The system also allows the business (read: Admin users) to assign *users* to brands.

These users can administrate their assigned brands' campaigns & programs, as well as administrate the database of users, but should not be able to segment or edit users that have not been allocated to the user's assigned brand(s).


### Campaigns

Campaigns are short lived communications to and from consumers.
This can be setup in the following ways:

- **Learn more about the consumer**
    - Create a campaign where users can SMS a short code and or fill out web forms to tell us a bit more about them.
    - This feeds the database with consumer details such as name, email, mobile, age, gender, *is a parent?*, marital status, location, *is pregnant?* and expected due date.
    - Create an entry point to enter a competition or sign up for further communication (perhaps to tie into a program)
- **Direct communication**
    - Deploy an email
    - Deploy an SMS
    - Deploy both
- **Full campaign**
    - Send out emails and SMS’s to consumers with a call to action driving to a web form
    - Collect and track information from web form to tie back to consumer profile


### Programs

Programs are a series of communications that are distributed at regular intervals over a longer term. For example:

- Post opt-in campaign users might be exposed to.
    - Huggies Cadence Calendar – unlike a campaign that has a start and end date determined on communication a program works out when the mother that is expecting’s due date.  Thus calculate the nature of email communication required to the pregnancy due date and duly deploying weekly mailers specific to the development of the child.
    - Kotex Period SMS Reminder – again calculate as to the female cycling in order to trigger an SMS to notify her about a defined time to expect her period.
